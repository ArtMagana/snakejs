# Snake.js

A neat little snake-like game developed as I learn about HTML5 and JavaScript.

Goal is to have the following variants:
- Regular single player snake
- Snake AI to play regular mode
- An adversarial snake variant (you vs an AI and compete for nibbles, block, or eat each other)

Issues and Improvements:
- Make AI not block itself off as often i.e. leave some space.
- Improve gen. neighbours such that it can detect if space will free up or if AI can fill up space in blocked-off area.
- Add reset button instead of JS alert.
- Make the code better (refactor, standards).
